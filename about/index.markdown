A full-stack software engineer with more than 5 years experience, focused in mobile (Android) and web development. My experience includes exposure to Scrum agile framework, test-driven development (TDD) and unit testing with PHPUnit and JUnit, behaviour-driven testing with Cucumber, and Jenkins CI.

I am kind of a control freak, and obsessed with testing. I love soccer and motosport. I am a die-hard [*Inter Milan*](http://www.inter.it/en/hp) and [*Valentino Rossi*](http://www.valentinorossi.com/en/) fan.
